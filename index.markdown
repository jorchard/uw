I am an Associate Professor in the [David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science](http://cs.uwaterloo.ca){:target="_blank"} at the [University of Waterloo](http://uwaterloo.ca){:target="_blank"}. I am also a core member of the [Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience](http://ctn.uwaterloo.ca){:target="_blank"}.

My students and I form the [Neurocognitive Computing Lab]({{ site.baseurl }}/NeuroCog.html). Through computational experiments and mathematical analysis, we try to understand the neurological basis of perception, cognition, and behaviour.
