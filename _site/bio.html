  <h1 class="page-title">Brief Biography
</h1>
  <ol>
  <li>The universe started.</li>
  <li>I was born in Kitchener, Ontraio, in 1970 (AD).</li>
  <li>I attended Alexandra school from grades K-3 (Waterloo, Ontraio).</li>
  <li>Then Northdale from grades 3-6 (Waterloo, Ontario).</li>
  <li>Then MacGregor for grades 7 and 8 (Waterloo, Ontario).</li>
  <li>And then Waterloo Collegiate Institute from grades 9-13 (guess where).</li>
  <li>For some unknown reason, my parents bought a Commodore-64 computer in 1983.  I took to that computer like a geek to… well, like a geek to a computer.</li>
  <li>Even though I really wanted to leave Waterloo, the best university opportunity for me ended up being the University of Waterloo.</li>
  <li>I received my B.Math. degree from the University of Waterloo in applied math in 1994.  It was a co-op degree, so I got to work in Ottawa, Toronto, and Pinawa (Manitoba).</li>
  <li>I was blessed with the chance to move to the west coast of Canada for the next phase of my life.</li>
  <li>Got my M.Sc. degree from the University of British Columbia in applied math (dynamical systems) in 1996 (finally, I got out of Waterloo).</li>
  <li>I worked for 7 months as a software test engineer at Hughes aircraft… I didn’t really like it.</li>
  <li>Taught math at the Okanagan University College in Kelowna, BC, for 2 years.<br />
This, I liked.<br />
A bonus was that my girlfriend’s family lives in the Okanagan Valley.</li>
  <li>I <a href="http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jorchard/wedding/pictures.html">married</a> <a href="http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jorchard/tricia.html">Tricia Gee</a> on July 3, 1999.</li>
  <li>Started my Ph.D. in <a href="http://www.cs.sfu.ca/">Computing science</a> at <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/">Simon Fraser University</a> in 1999, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/computing/people/emeriti/stellaatkins.html">Prof. Stella Atkins</a>.</li>
  <li>I successfully defended my PhD <a href="https://sfu-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/usv8m3/01SFUL_ALMA21138603080003611">thesis</a> on April 15, 2003.</li>
  <li>On July 1, 2003, I started my job as an Assistant Professor in the <a href="http://cs.uwaterloo.ca">School of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca">University of Waterloo</a>.  OK, so I’m headed back to Waterloo.  But this time, it’s my choice.</li>
  <li>My daughter Heather was born on July 24, 2004.</li>
  <li>My second daughter Adelaide (Addie for short) was born on Nov. 20, 2005.</li>
  <li>My son Lauchlan was born on June 9, 2008.</li>
  <li>I was officially denied tenure on Feb. 26, 2009. Ugh.</li>
  <li>I appealed the tenure decision, and won on May 21, 2009. YES!</li>
  <li>I became an Associate Professor with tenure on July 1, 2009.</li>
  <li>Changed my research focus to computational neuroscience in 2010.</li>
  <li>The first neuroscience <a href="http://www.frontiersin.org/Journal/Abstract.aspx?s=237&amp;name=computational_neuroscience&amp;ART_DOI=10.3389/fncom.2013.00179&amp;utm_source=Email_to_rerev_&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author1&amp;utm_campaign=Email_publication">journal article</a> from my lab was published in 2013.</li>
  <li>Moved to Bristol, England (with family in tow) for 12-month sabbatical, 2013-2014. I was hosted by the <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/psychology/">School of Experimental Psychology</a>, and was honoured with the title <strong>IAS Benjamin Meaker Visiting Professor</strong>.</li>
  <li>Moved back to Canada after my sabbatical.</li>
  <li>I am taking my family on another 12-month sabbatical, this time to the <a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/">University of Otago</a> in Dunedin, New Zealand, hosted by the <a href="https://aigrp.otago.ac.nz/">Artificial Intelligence Group</a>.</li>
