8. Even though I really wanted to leave Waterloo, the best university opportunity for me ended up being the University of Waterloo.

10. I was blessed with the chance to move to the west coast of Canada for the next phase of my life.
11. Got my M.Sc. degree from the University of British Columbia in applied math (dynamical systems) in 1996 (finally, I got out of Waterloo).
12. I worked for 7 months as a software test engineer at Hughes aircraft... I didn't really like it.
13. Taught math at the Okanagan University College in Kelowna, BC, for 2 years.<br>
This, I liked.<br>
A bonus was that my girlfriend's family lives in the Okanagan Valley.

16. On July 1, 2003, I started my job as an Assistant Professor in the [School of Computer Science](http://cs.uwaterloo.ca) at the [University of Waterloo](http://uwaterloo.ca).  OK, so I'm headed back to Waterloo.  But this time, it's my choice.
17. My daughter Heather was born on July 24, 2004.

22. I became an Associate Professor with tenure on July 1, 2009.
23. Changed my research focus to computational neuroscience in 2010.
24. The first neuroscience [journal article](http://www.frontiersin.org/Journal/Abstract.aspx?s=237&name=computational_neuroscience&ART_DOI=10.3389/fncom.2013.00179&utm_source=Email_to_rerev_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author1&utm_campaign=Email_publication) from my lab was published in 2013.
25. Moved to Bristol, England (with family in tow) for 12-month sabbatical, 2013-2014. I was hosted by the [School of Experimental Psychology](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/psychology/), and was honoured with the title **IAS Benjamin Meaker Visiting Professor**.
26. Moved back to Canada after my sabbatical.
27. I was supposed to take my family on another 12-month sabbatical to New Zealand. However, the coronavirus pandemic hit just a few months before, so it's been delayed.
28. Once the pandemic settled down, I took my family to Sydney, Australia, for a 6-month sabbatical (Aug 2022 - Jan 2023). I worked with the [International Centre for Neuromorphic Systems](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/icns){:target="_blank"} at [Western Sydney University](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/){:target="_blank"}.
