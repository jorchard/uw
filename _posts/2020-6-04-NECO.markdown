Master's student Wei Sun and Prof. Jeff Orchard published their work on generative Predictive Coding (PC) in the journal *Neural Computation*. The paper describes why PC networks are not usually generative (ie. not able to produce a reasonable input sample from a chosen output class). This is a vastly expanded version of our idea first presented at [NeurIPS in 2019]({{ site.baseurl }}/jekyll/update/2019/10/31/NeurIPS.html).
