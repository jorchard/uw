At her convocation from the Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN), Mallory will be honoured with not just one, but **two** [University Medals for Academic Excellence (Grenfell Campus)](https://www.mun.ca/scholarships/scholarships/convocation.php), one for Computational Mathematics, and one for Physics. Join me in congratulating Mallory on her achievement. We're proud to have her here at Waterloo now.
