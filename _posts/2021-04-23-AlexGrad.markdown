Congratulations to Alex van de Kleut for handing in his master's thesis, and therefor completing his MMath degree.

His thesis explores how reinforcement learning methods can use images as input. He points out that some tasks that are often used to demonstrate image-encoding methods can actually be done effectively (or better) without those elaborate encodings.

You can check out his thesis,
